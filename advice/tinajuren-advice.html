			<h4>One step at a time!</h4>
			<p>When I started my programming journey (two weeks ago!) I felt lost at times. And I still do, bacause it's normal. To stay focused can be really hard at these moments.</p>

			<p>To take one step at a time, therefore, is a cure to stay focused. It's a perfect trick to keep you engaged in the problem solving pursuit. I has helps me continue coding even when it feels almost impossible. If you take one step you can then take the next, and the next.</p>

			<h4>Give youself a break!</h4>
			<p>When I'm good at taking a beak my results improve. It's as simple as that. For me a break means small things like grabbing a cup of coffee or say a few kind things to myself, out loud so I can here them. Never give up, instead, be proud of yourself.</p>

			<p>A break fills up your energy storage, even the small ones.</p>

			<p>And never forget to remind yourself WHY you started to learn code in the first place. I started to code because I simply couldn't keep away from it - coding makes me feel confident.</p>
